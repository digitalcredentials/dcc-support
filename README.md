# dcc-support
Repo for help requests and questions, maintained by the Digital Credentials Consortium (DCC) at MIT. 

# Service Desk

Service Desk system for all DCC projects and tech.

## What is this?

This repository can be used to record issue requests to the service organisation operated by the DCC. Like requesting access to or gaining new accounts, having issues with hardware, or have problems with your workstation or phone.

This is not for software production issues; that is for the devteam, reach out via email.

Implementers having questions or problems with the usage of the DCC wallet, issuer, admin dashboard, etc., will need to go open an issue here.

## How does it work?

When you want to register an item, create a new issue here.

The issue will be automatically assigned to the service team at the DCC and they will respond via the issue.
