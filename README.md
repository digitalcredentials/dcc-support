## What is this?

This repository can be used to record issue requests to the technology and services operated by the DCC. Any issues encountered within the scope of a DCC GitHub repository should be reported here. Some examples of repositories you may want to open an issue for are:

- learner-credential-wallet
- admin-dashboard
- issuer coordinator

Implementers having questions or problems with the usage of the DCC wallet, issuer, admin dashboard, or any other repository from the DCC organization, will need to go open an issue here under dcc-support.

## How does it work?

When you want to register an item, create a new issue here. You can select a Bug Report, Feature Request, or customize your own issue. When following the issue templates, please be sure to specify the specific GitHub repository where you encountered your issue, along with any relevant errors and/or screenshots.

The issue will be automatically assigned to the service team at the DCC and they will respond via the issue.
